# Devops-Demo
This is a demo app for DevOps lesson of NUS FintechSG course. <br>
The purpose of this homework is to understand the CI/CD automation using Github actions, Docker, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). <br>
The repository was modified from the sample provided in [https://github.com/u1i/nodejs-api](https://github.com/u1i/nodejs-api). <br>
The web app itself is just a dummy app as the purpose is to learn CI/CD automation. Link: https://devops-demo-evijngw6hq-uc.a.run.app/ <br>
The end goal to be achieved is automatic setup, build, publish and deploy with Docker and GCP via Github actions. <br>
